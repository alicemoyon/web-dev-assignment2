Web Application Development module assignment 2 (Higher Diploma in Computer Science)

This assignment focuses on the use of JavaScript to read, manipulate and present JSON data in an interactive webpage.

The data is included in two files:

1. prizesByYear.json – this file provides information on Nobel Prize winners from 1970 to 2018.
2. winnersByID.json – this file provides further information on individual winners, listed by id.

NB re the gender filtering logic: Any gender other than male or female will be displayed in both
female only results and male only results. It made sense to do it this way as the other
current value in the json file is ‘org’ for organisation, and both males and females work in
those organisation and could have played a part in winning the award.
